The steps:

1. Update your code base on develop branch
2. Run the 'tests\test10\HSPFresults\test10.uci' to generate the 3 HBN output files
3. Re-Run 3-step process in HSP2_Driver.py code in 'tests\test10\HSP2results\' to update your test10.h5 output file
4. Run the 'tests\convert\conversion_test.py' code to see conversion testing report

The conversion testing report is in HTML format (i.e. test_report_conversion.html)
It should pop up in a web browser after the testing program finish, if not,
one can open the html file in a browser.
